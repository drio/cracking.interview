I decided to take a different approach for these. When possible (and I think
that should be the case quite often) I will add a Web UI interface to the
solution. Like [this](http://drio.github.io/cracking.interview/1_arrays_strings/8_is_rotation/).

While attacking the problems in plain cli approaches is beneficial, exposing the
solution via web allows me to explore and improve my knowledge in the web ecosystem
(http, css, javascript and [d3](http://d3js.org).
